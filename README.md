# WeightedSetPackingLocal

Local Search: Attempt to replace a small subset of the solution by some collection of greater total weight that does not intersect the remainder of the solution. For such a search to be polynomially bounded, it has to be restricted in some way, such as that either the number of sets added or the number of sets removed should be constant.

Right now, the number of subsets to be replaced is t, a constant.
